# Maximum Fedora version currently supported by NVIDIA's CUDA repository
# NVIDIA often lags behind Fedora releases. When a new Fedora version is released
# (e.g., F43), we often need to point to the repository of the previous stable
# version (e.g., F42) until NVIDIA updates their repos.
# If the detected Fedora version is newer than this, the role will fall back to
# using this version's repository to ensure compatibility.
